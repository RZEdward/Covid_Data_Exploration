# Covid_Data_Exploration

Welcome!

In this project I aim to present some interesting global insights pertaining to Covid infections, fatalities, and vaccinations since January 2020.

General Steps:

- Download the data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
- Display in Excel
- Separate the data into 2 workbooks (fatalities/vaccinations)
- Save each workbook as a CSV
- Write Python script that reads input CSVs and generates the SQL CREATE TABLE statement (stores column names and identifies data types then prints the statement)
- Launch a database in PostgreSQL/ pgAdmin
- Create Tables FATALITIES/VACCINATIONS
- Work out what we actually want to visualize - create view statements accordingly
- Launch a workbook in Tableau
- Connect to the local PostgreSQL server and add relevant data sources
- Use analysis -> create calculated field where necessary to refine data selection
- Create sheets - infections, fatalities, vaccinations, trend lines, data maps, bar charts
- Create dashboard(s) - present ideas 
- Publish to Tableau Public
- Publish SQL/Python to Github
