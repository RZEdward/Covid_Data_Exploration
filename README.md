# Covid_Data_Exploration

Welcome!

In this project I aim to present some interesting data and conclusions pertaining to Covid fatalities and vaccinations since January 2020.

General Steps:

- Download the data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
- Display in Excel
- Separate the data into 2 workbooks (fatalities/vaccinations)
- Save each workbook as a CSV
- Write Python script that reads input CSVs and generates the SQL CREATE TABLE statement (stores column names and identifies data types then prints the statement)
- Launch a database in PostgreSQL/ pgAdmin
- Create Tables FATALITIES/VACCINATIONS
- Import data from corresponding CSVs
